# üè® Hotel Bookings Analytics

## Problem Statement
In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal hotel room usage. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates are both hotels' primary goal in order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business advice to resolve this problem.

## My Recommendations
Suggestions
1. Cancellation rates rise as price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates of specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to customers.

2. In the month of January hotel can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancelation is highest as the cancelation is highest in that month.

3. They can also provide special discounts on weekdays, as large number of cancelation take place on there.
